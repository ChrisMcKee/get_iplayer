How to install get_iplayer

I assume a unix-like system. It's doable with strawberry perl too, but you'll probably need help from someone who uses it to get it working.

There are two get_iplayers here and for each, instructions to install and run it, thus four sets of instructions.

If you just want to use it, use the simple script. If you want to develop on it, use the new version

INSTALLING THE SIMPLE SCRIPT

1. Check out the latest version from git:

git clone git://github.com/jjl/get_iplayer.git

2. Copy it to somewhere sensible and chmod it

sudo cp get_iplayer/get_iplayer /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/get_iplayer

RUNNING THE SIMPLE SCRIPT FROM WHERE IT IS

1. Check out the latest version from git:

git clone git://github.com/jjl/get_iplayer.git

2. Run it.

./get_iplayer.pl <args>

RUNNING THE NEW VERSION

1. Check out the latest version from git:

git clone git://github.com/jjl/get_iplayer.git

2. Check out the submodules

git submodule update

3. Run the main.pl script

perl main.pl <usual get_iplayer args>

INSTALLING THE NEW VERSION

If you want to do this, put down the crack pipe, it's not really ready.

1. Check out the latest version from git:

git clone git://github.com/jjl/get_iplayer.git

2. Install dependencies (do this as root, by doing `sudo -s` first)

wget -O - http://cpanmin.us | perl - Mouse MouseX::NativeTraits

(Thanks Miyagawa!)

3. Copy the script to somewhere easily accessible and make it executable

cp get_iplayer /usr/local/bin/
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/get_iplayer
