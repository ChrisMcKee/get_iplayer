How to install get_iplayer

I assume a unix-like system. It's doable with strawberry perl too, but you'll probably need help from someone who uses it to get it working.

If you don't want to install it and you just need to run it, here is all you have to do:

1. Check out the latest version from git:

git clone git://github.com/jjl/get_iplayer.git

2. Check out the submodules

git submodule update

3. Run the run.pl script

perl run.pl <usual get_iplayer args>



If you do want to install it, you'll need to do these instead:

1. Check out the latest version from git:

git clone git://github.com/jjl/get_iplayer.git

2. Install dependencies (do this as root, by doing `sudo -s` first)

wget -O - http://cpanmin.us | perl - Mouse MouseX::NativeTraits

(Thanks Miyagawa!)

3. Copy the script to somewhere easily accessible and make it executable

cp get_iplayer /usr/local/bin/
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/get_iplayer


Please note these directions are temporary, when the refactoring is done, it'll be much, much easier
